# Functional Aesthetics
## About
This mod was designed with a few key concepts in mind :

**Functionality** - Blocks should be useful, tons and tons of blocks that have no purpose is just clutter   
**Simplicity** - All blocks should be simple to use, crafting recipes will never be complex with tons of nesting   
**Immersion** - There will never be any GUI's for anything other than crafting   
**Configurability** - Features and modules of the mod can be configured and enabled/disabled   
**Compatibility** - All models are built off of vanilla textures, this allows the mod to look natural with any resource pack   
**Vanilla Aesthetic** - All models are kept simple to fit in line with the vanilla aesthetic, angled blocks are used sparingly to add detail and impact
